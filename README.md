# -A-Machine-Learning-Model-for-Average-Fuel-Consumption-in-Heavy-Vehicles
Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the average fuel consumption of heavy vehicles. The transportation industry plays a critical role in the economy, and fuel consumption is a significant operational cost. By accurately predicting fuel consumption, we can optimize routes, reduce costs, and minimize environmental impact.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a regression model that takes into account various factors influencing fuel consumption in heavy vehicles and provides accurate predictions. The model will be trained on a dataset containing historical fuel consumption data and corresponding vehicle attributes.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of real-world fuel consumption data of heavy vehicles. It includes various features such as vehicle weight, engine capacity, distance traveled, route type, and more.
